Got it, Sparsh — here’s a **text-only, judge-grabbing** README version of that style, stripped of all images but keeping the bold, punchy language and clear structure so it still stands out.

## 🌟 Why This Project Matters

Our system transforms **raw, unstructured documents** into **actionable knowledge**—instantly.
With **FAISS-powered semantic search** and **LLM-driven contextual answering**, you no longer just search for keywords; you retrieve **meaning**.

* ⚡ **Instant Knowledge Extraction** – Ask a question, get an accurate, context-rich answer
* 🧠 **Semantic Understanding** – Goes beyond keyword matching to understand intent
* 📚 **Multi-Document Search** – Handles large collections with ease
* 🔒 **Secure API Access** – Configurable bearer token authentication
* 📊 **Confidence Scoring** – Every answer comes with reasoning and reliability score

---

## 🎯 Core Features

If you want, I can **tighten this even further** into a **brutally concise, 2–3 minute-read version** so a judge gets the value proposition in seconds without scrolling. That would make it *even harder to ignore*.

Do you want me to go for that sharper version next?
